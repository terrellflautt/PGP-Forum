## 💡 Why We Built This

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a luxury. Existing platforms either:
- ❌ Sell your data for profit
- ❌ Lack true end-to-end encryption
- ❌ Are too expensive for small communities
- ❌ Are complex and hard to use

**SnapIT Forums solves all of this:**
- ✅ Zero-knowledge architecture (we literally can't read your data)
- ✅ True end-to-end encryption (not marketing fluff)
- ✅ Generous free tier (1,500 users!)
- ✅ Simple, beautiful UX (signup in 30 seconds)

---

## 🎯 Our Promise

1. **Your data is yours** - We never sell, share, or analyze it
2. **Privacy by default** - Encryption is always on, not optional
3. **No vendor lock-in** - Export your data anytime
4. **Transparent pricing** - No hidden fees or surprise charges
5. **Always improving** - We listen to feedback and ship fast
