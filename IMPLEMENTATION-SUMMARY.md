## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Verify Stripe products in dashboard
2. Ensure SNS topic exists and is subscribed
3. Have AWS CLI configured

### Step 1: Deploy Dashboard & Alarms

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/decry/Desktop/snapit-forum
./setup-revenue-analytics.sh
```

This will:
- Create CloudWatch dashboard
- Set up 5 CloudWatch alarms

### Step 2: Deploy Backend (Stripe Webhook)

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

This will:
- Deploy enhanced Stripe webhook handler
- Update IAM permissions
- Enable CloudWatch metrics

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
  --alarm-name-prefix snapit \
  --region us-east-1
```

### Step 4: Setup Google Analytics 4 (Manual)

Follow guide: `GOOGLE-ANALYTICS-4-SETUP.md`

1. Create GA4 property
2. Get Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Add tracking code to `forum-app/public/index.html`
4. Create analytics utility file
5. Integrate into components
6. Test in GA4 DebugView
7. Create conversion events
8. Set up funnel exploration

  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Sum \
  --region us-east-1
```

### 2. Test SNS Notifications

```bash
# Watch Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/snapit-forum-api-prod-stripeWebhook \
