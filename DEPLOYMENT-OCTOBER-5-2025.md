## Team Communication

### What to Tell Stakeholders
"We successfully deployed SnapIT Forums to production on October 5, 2025 at 23:58 UTC. The platform is now live at forum.snapitsoftware.com with all features operational, including Progressive Web App capabilities, mobile optimization, and enterprise-grade monitoring. We're ready to onboard users and start processing payments."

### What to Tell Marketing
"The platform is live and ready for launch campaigns. We have a generous free tier (1,500 users), Pro tier at $99/month, and Business tier at $499/month. Key selling points: privacy-first (end-to-end encryption), works offline, installs like a native app, and has a 30-second signup flow."

### What to Tell Support
"All systems are operational. Common user questions: (1) How to install the app - show them the install prompt, (2) How to create a forum - it's one click from the dashboard, (3) Pricing - free up to 1,500 users. Escalate any bugs or errors immediately via CloudWatch logs."
