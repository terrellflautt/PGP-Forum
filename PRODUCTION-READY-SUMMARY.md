## 🔐 Security & Privacy Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Design
- **Client-side PGP encryption** (Web Cryptography API)
- **Private keys**: Stored in IndexedDB with `.extractable = false`
- **Server cannot decrypt**: Zero-knowledge architecture
- **Metadata restraint**: Connection logs immediately deleted

### Ephemeral Messaging
- **Auto-deletion**: 60s after delivery (DynamoDB TTL)
- **No permanent storage**: ProtonMail-style privacy
- **Text-only validation**: No metadata tracking in forum posts

### Compliance Ready
- **GDPR**: EU data isolation architecture designed
- **SOC 2**: Logging and audit trail infrastructure
- **Data Sovereignty**: Regional deployment ready (Russia 242-FZ, Brazil LGPD)

**Competitive Advantage**: "Because it's all encrypted." 🔐
