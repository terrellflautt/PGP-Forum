## Critical Alarms (Revenue Protection)

### OAuth/Signup Funnel
| Alarm Name | Threshold | Protects |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| googleAuth-errors | >1 error/5min | OAuth initiation |
| googleCallback-errors | >1 error/5min | OAuth completion |
| setUsername-errors | >1 error/5min | User onboarding |
| authorizer-errors | >10 errors/5min | API authentication |

### Stripe Payment Processing
| Alarm Name | Threshold | Protects |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| stripeWebhook-errors | >1 error/5min | Payment confirmations |
| createCheckoutSession-errors | >1 error/5min | New subscriptions |
| createPortalSession-errors | >1 error/5min | Subscription management |

### Infrastructure Health
| Alarm Name | Threshold | Protects |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| api-5xx-errors | >5 errors/5min | API availability |
| api-4xx-errors | >50 errors/5min | Client errors |
| api-high-latency | P95 >3000ms | User experience |
| lambda-concurrent-executions | >800 | Service capacity |

### Cost Protection
| Alarm Name | Threshold | Protects |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| estimated-charges | >$10/month | Budget overruns |
| api-high-request-rate | >10K requests/hour | Traffic spikes |
| dynamodb-high-read-capacity | >100K units/hour | Database costs |

## Free Tier Usage (Current)

### DynamoDB
- Storage: ~0 GB / 25 GB (0% used)
- Status: Well within free tier

### Lambda
- Invocations: ~31,000 / 1,000,000 per month (3% used)
- Concurrent: <10 / 1,000 limit (1% used)
- Status: Well within free tier

### API Gateway
- Requests: <1,000 / 1,000,000 per month (<1% used)
- Status: Well within free tier

### CloudWatch
- Logs: Optimized retention (7-30 days)
- Alarms: 30 (within free tier: 10 free + $0.10 each = ~$2/month)
- Dashboard: 1 (within free tier: 3 free)

**Estimated Monitoring Cost:** ~$2/month (CloudWatch alarms only)

## Next Steps (ACTION REQUIRED)

### 1. Subscribe to Alerts
```bash
aws sns subscribe \
  --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:692859945539:snapit-forum-production-alerts \
  --protocol email \
  --notification-endpoint YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
```

### 2. Test Alert System
```bash
aws sns publish \
  --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:692859945539:snapit-forum-production-alerts \
  --subject "Test Alert" \
  --message "Testing monitoring system"
```

### 3. Review Dashboard
Open: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards/dashboard/snapit-forum-production

Verify you can see:
- OAuth signup metrics
- API request volumes
- Error rates
- Latency trends

## Documentation Created

1. **PRODUCTION-MONITORING-SETUP.md** - Complete deployment details
2. **MONITORING-QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - Daily operations guide
3. **AUTHORIZER-ALARM-INVESTIGATION.md** - Alarm investigation example
4. **MONITORING-DEPLOYMENT-COMPLETE.md** - This file

---

## Alarm Adjustments Made

### Initial Deployment Issues
- Authorizer alarm was too sensitive (threshold: 1 error)
- Adjusted to 10 errors/5min (filters out normal invalid token rejections)

### Why This Matters
The authorizer SHOULD reject invalid tokens. Only alert if there's a pattern indicating OAuth is completely broken.

---

## What's Protected Now

### Revenue Paths
1. **User Signup Flow**
   - Google OAuth → googleCallback → setUsername → User Created
   - Any failure = immediate alert

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Checkout → Stripe → stripeWebhook → Subscription Active
   - Any failure = immediate alert

3. **Customer Management**
   - Portal Session → Stripe Portal → Subscription Changes
   - Any failure = immediate alert

### Infrastructure
- API Gateway 5xx errors (service down)
- High latency (poor user experience)
- Lambda throttling (capacity issues)
- DynamoDB throttling (database issues)

### Cost Control
- Monthly spend >$10
- Unusual traffic spikes
- Database capacity spikes

## Monitoring Maturity Roadmap

### Phase 1: Launch (Current) ✓
- CloudWatch Alarms
- Basic dashboard
- Error tracking
- Free tier monitoring

### Phase 2: First 100 Users (Next)
- Add conversion rate tracking
- Custom business metrics
- User growth alerts
- Payment success rate

### Phase 3: Revenue >$1K/month
- AWS X-Ray distributed tracing
- Custom CloudWatch metrics
- Uptime monitoring (external)
- PagerDuty integration

### Phase 4: Enterprise Scale
- Multi-region monitoring
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Predictive scaling
- SLA tracking

---

## Success Metrics

Your monitoring is successful when:

1. **No Silent Failures**
   - Every revenue-impacting error triggers an alert
   - You learn about issues before customers complain

2. **Actionable Alerts**
   - Each alert has clear next steps
   - False positive rate <5%

3. **Cost Visibility**
   - Free tier usage always known
   - No surprise bills

4. **Performance Baseline**
   - P95 latency tracked
   - Error rates trended over time

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: I'm not receiving alerts**
A: Check SNS subscription is confirmed (check email for confirmation link)

**Q: Too many false alarms**
A: Adjust thresholds in individual alarms (see MONITORING-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)

**Q: Dashboard shows no data**
A: Wait 24-48 hours after deployment for metrics to populate

**Q: Alarm says INSUFFICIENT_DATA**
A: Normal for new deployment or low traffic. Ignore unless persists >48 hours.

### When to Escalate

Contact AWS Support if:
- API Gateway consistently returns 5xx errors
- Lambda functions timeout repeatedly
- DynamoDB shows persistent throttling
- Billing alarm triggers unexpectedly
